## Description
This project is meant to be for either creating, storing, or simply archiving characters made with the Dungeons and Dragon's system in mind. This may be expanded upon in the future should more work be done for other systems. It allows the user to input a characters species, alignment, class, subclass, levels, and even if they have multiclassed. The user can also keep track of hp and change it along with a characters stats as a stat tracker of it's own. Items can also be added or removed from the inventory box as well. Then the user can also upload their own image to the character sheet, then save it into a json so it can be accessed later without needing to remake it.
