## Description
This will be a program that allows a user to input data for their dnd character and keep track of their health, statistics, equipment, and inventory.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- The user can create a character and fill out some information about them to then be able to keep track of them.
- Feature 2
	- The user will be able to add and subtract from the total hp, or set a new value if the total has changed.
- Feature 3
	- The user will be able to keep track of their characters stat scores, while also being able to add and subtract from them if necessary.
- Feature 4 
	- The user can also keep track of what items that are in their inventory and what gear they currently have equipped on their character.

## Challenges
- I'll need to learn how to create an inventory management system that links to equipment slots for a character.
- I will need to learn how to make a repository document that contains statistics for different character aspects like their race.
- A very important thing I will need to learn how to do is for a characters save file to be able to be accessed at a later time or able be swapped to.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- I will be able to create a fully functioning D&D character archive and stat/equipment tracker for multiple characters.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- If I can at least get it to track one character at a time instead of multiple, it will still be good enough to accomplish my initial goal

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Create initial character creation/outline
  2. Be able to save that character file

- Week 2
  1. Implement ability to change stats whenever the user wants too
  2. Add equipment slots to character

- Week 3 (Final)
  1. Add main menu option for switching to different character save files
  2. Create more in depth stats for character creation options and equipment
